/*   Abstraction
 *   Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing functionality to the user
 * 
 *   With using Interfaces we can achieve Data Abstraction
 *   
 *   
 *   Interfaces
 *    
 *  1. An interface is the blue print of class (interface is kinda class)
 *  2. Interface contains static and final variables (No need to mention the word) 
 *  3. Interface contains abstract methods (Also allowed default and static methods after java 8) 
 *  4. An abstract methods contains signature but not body of the method (Un implemented method)
 *  5. Methods in Interface are public
 *  6. Interface supports the functionality of the multiple inheritance
 *  7. We can define the  interface is an interface keyword
 *  8. Class extends class, Interface extends interface, and class implements interface
 *  9. we can create the object ref for interface can't do the instantiation
 *
